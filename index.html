            <p>We have made this game to see your ability to draw pictures under the pressure of time!
                Below you will be given various images, and your task is to draw them out in the grid
                beside the given image, where you will be scored on accuracy!</p>

                <p>My name is Vinamra Tyagi, and I go by Vin. I am a sophomore CS UMass
                    student, thoroughly involved in developing and refining software since
                    2018. I have interests in ML/RL, and full-stack SWE. I have developed
                    a passion for developing functional programs that benefit not only
                    myself, but the world as a whole. I believe in the potential that CS
                    has for improving our planet, and would love to use my skills as a
                    developer to bring about that change!

                    My name is Victor Chen and I am a sophomore at UMass studying CS and
                    Math. I enjoy learning about machine learning and hope to explore its
                    applications to fields like biology. Computational methods provide
                    crucial insights in tackling problems in biology and improving our
                    collective understanding of diseases and life. I also have experience
                    with education and enjoy helping people learn while motivating them to
                    pursue their interests.
